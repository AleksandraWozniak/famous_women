    <string name="body_details_description_dalia">Dalia Grybauskaitė (born in Vilnius on 1 March 1956), referred to as the \"Iron Lady\" or the
        \"Steel Magnolia\", is the President of Lithuania, inaugurated on 12 July 2009 and re-elected in May 2014. \nShe is the country\'s first
        female President and the first President of Lithuania to be reelected for a second consecutive term. \nIn her declaration speech for the 2009
        presidential election, Dalia Grybauskaitė said: \"I decided to return to Lithuania if the Lithuanian people decide I am needed there now.
        I think that we all long for the truth, transparency and responsibility for our country. We all want to live without fear, with confidence
        in ourselves, in each other, and in tomorrow. I can and I want to contribute with my experience, knowledge and skills to expel shadows from
        morality, politics, and economics to create a citizen-ruled Lithuania – a state of citizens. Therefore, I will run for the Lithuanian presidency.
        \" The international press was quick to dub her the \"Lithuanian Iron Lady\" for her outspoken speech and her black belt in karate.
        Dalia Grybauskaitė, who speaks Lithuanian, English, Russian, French and Polish, has mentioned Margaret Thatcher and Mahatma Gandhi as her
        political role models. \nShe was Vice-Minister of Finance (from 1999 to 2000), Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs (from 2000-2001) and Minister
        of Finance (from 2001 to 2004). Lithuania joined the European Union on 1 May 2004, and Dalia Grybauskaitė was named a European Commissioner
        on the same day. She initially served as European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth. She held this position
        until 11 November 2004, when she was named European Commissioner for Financial Programming and the Budget within the José Manuel Barroso-led
        Commission. In November 2005, she was elected Commissioner of the Year for her efforts to reform the EU budget. Dalia Grybauskaitė never had
        dreamt of becoming president, but rather pursued her career to the highest possible level, working hard at every opportunity.
        Her determination led her to run for presidency and seemed at the time to be the natural progression of her career. \nOn May 9, 2013
        President Dalia Grybauskaitė was presented the prestigious International Charlemagne Prize. The award, also known as \"Oscar in Politics\",
        has been extended to President Grybauskaitė for Lithuania\'s contribution to uniting the European Union and building the economic stability
        of the whole Europe. \"I dedicate the Charlemagne Prize, awarded by the people of Aachen, to the Lithuanian people. It signifies the
        recognition of our united efforts as we fought for Lithuania\'s freedom and its place in Europe as well as to overcome the economic crisis.
        This award is also a commitment to assume responsibility for bringing all the nations together to shape the future of Europe,\" the President
        emphasized at the award ceremony. \nDalia Grybauskaitė takes 68 place in Frobes The World\'s 100 Most Powerful Women list (2017 ranking).
        \nToday, Dalia is a modern leader and maintains a strong connection with the Lithuanian people through social media interaction,
        sharing her news, schedule and ideas.</string>

    <string name="body_details_description_elisabeta">Elisabeta Rizea (28 June 1912 – 6 October 2003) was a Romanian anti-communist partisan in the
        Făgăraş Mountains of Northern Wallachia. After the Romanian Revolution, she became the symbol of Romania\'s anti-communism resistance.
        Rizea was born in Nucșoara, a small village in Argeş County in the Southern Carpathians, to a family of peasants who lived off plot of
        cultivated land. After World War II, as the Soviet Army imposed a Communist government in Romania, the peasants had to give up their
        land in order to implement collective farming. Out of opposition to this, Elisabeta Rizea and her husband joined an anti-Communist guerrilla
        group, Haiducii Muscelului, led by Colonel Gheorghe Arsenescu. Her assigned task within the group was to provide food and supplies.
        After she was captured by the Romanian militia in 1952, she was declared \"duşman al poporului\" (enemy of the people) and sentenced to
        death because she refused to give information about the other partisans. Eventually her sentence was commuted to seven years in prison.
        When Arsenescu was arrested in 1961, her sentence was extended by another 25 years, but three years later, in 1964, she was freed under
        the terms of a general amnesty.
        During her twelve years spent in prison, she was subjected to various forms of torture: she was hung by her hair from a hook and beaten
        until she fainted due to broken ribs, and was also scalped, burned, and beaten with a shovel. Upon her release from prison, she had no hair
        and she couldn\'t walk, as her knees had been destroyed by the torture.</string>

    <string name="body_details_description_mother_theresa">Mother Teresa (1910–1997) was a Roman Catholic nun who devoted her life to serving
    the poor and destitute around the world. Mother Teresa was born in 1910 in Skopje, the capital of the Republic of Macedonia.
    Little is known about her early life, but at a young age, she felt a calling to be a nun and serve through helping the poor.
    At the age of 18, she was given permission to join a group of nuns in Ireland. After a few months of training, with the Sisters of Loreto,
    she was then given permission to travel to India. She took her formal religious vows in 1931 and chose to be named after St Therese of Lisieux –
    the patron saint of missionaries.On her arrival in India, she began by working as a teacher; however, the widespread poverty of Calcutta
    made a deep impression on her, and this led to her starting a new order called “The Missionaries of Charity”. The primary objective
    of this mission was to look after people, who nobody else was prepared to look after.
    In 1948, she left the convent to live full-time among the poorest of Calcutta. She chose to wear a white Indian sari,
    with a blue border, out of respect for the traditional Indian dress. For many years, Mother Teresa and a small band of fellow nuns
    survived on minimal income and food, often having to beg for funds. But, slowly her efforts with the poorest were noted and appreciated
    by the local community and Indian politicians. In 1952, she opened her first home for the dying, which allowed people to die with dignity.
    The Missionaries of Charity now has branches throughout the world including branches in the developed world where they work with the homeless
    and people affected by AIDS. In 1965, the organisation became an International Religious Family by a decree of Pope Paul VI.
    In the 1960s, the life of Mother Teresa was brought to a wider public attention by Malcolm Muggeridge who wrote a book
    and produced a documentary called “Something Beautiful for God”.In 1979, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize “for work undertaken
    in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitutes a threat to peace.” She didn’t attend the ceremonial banquet
    but asked that the $192,000 fund be given to the poor. Over the last two decades of her life, Mother Teresa suffered various health problems,
    but nothing could dissuade her from fulfilling her mission of serving the poor and needy. Until her very last illness she was active
    in travelling around the world to the different branches of The Missionaries of Charity.
    Following Mother Teresa’s death, the Vatican began the process of beatification, which is the second step on the way to canonization and sainthood.
    Mother Teresa was formally beatified in October 2003 by Pope John Paul II.</string>

    <string name="body_details_description_sirleaf"> Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is the world\'s first elected black female president and Africa\'s first elected female head of state.
        Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was born on October 29, 1938, in Monrovia, Liberia. A graduate of the College of West Africa at Monrovia, she went on to receive her bachelor\'s degree in accounting from the Madison Business College in Madison, Wisconsin, a degree in economics from the University of Colorado at Boulder and a Master of Public Administration degree from Harvard University.
        After returning to Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf served as assistant minister of Finance in President William Tolbert\'s administration. In 1980, Tolbert was overthrown and killed by army sergeant Samuel Doe, who represented the Krahn ethnic group. Johnson Sirleaf went into exile in Nairobi, Kenya, as well as in the United States, where she worked as an executive in the international banking community.
        In 1985, Johnson Sirleaf returned to Liberia and ran for a seat in the Senate, but when she spoke out against Doe\'s military regime, she was sentenced to 10 years in prison. She served a partial sentence before moving to Washington, D.C. When she returned to her native country for a third time in 1997, it was as an economist, working for the World Bank and Citibank in Africa.
        After supporting Charles Taylor's bloody rebellion against President Samuel Doe in 1990, Johnson Sirleaf ran unsuccessfully against Taylor in the 1997 presidential election. Taylor subsequently charged Johnson Sirleaf with treason. In 2005, after campaigning for the removal of President Taylor, Johnson Sirleaf took over as leader of the Unity Party.
        That year, promising economic development and an end to corruption and civil war, she was elected to the Liberian presidency. When she was inaugurated in 2006, Johnson Sirleaf, or the "Iron Lady," as she was also known, became the world's first elected black female president and Africa's first elected female head of state.
        Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has four sons and six grandchildren, some of whom live in Atlanta, Georgia. </string>
