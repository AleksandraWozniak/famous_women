<h2>Hello all</h2>

I have changed a MIWOK application for you - from the UDACITY course *(Android Basic: Multiscreen App)* - for to apply it to create the application about famous women that we want to do. Based on this code, we can write our own.

I would like each of us to get acquainted with this before starting work. Thanks to this, it will be easier to imagine what work awaits us :).
Don't be afraid to ask, if you don't understand some part of it. 

Just right now is the time to explain this whole mess ;).

Our first task, will be to search for information about all functions, that we should use to create our application. 
The sample code will be of help - I would like us to write an explanation of each part of this application, so that everyone can understand it. Something like instruction or scientific help.

List of works and functions to be explained, I will elaborate (I am counting that @Ola help me here), and I share ready version as I promised next week. Now I would like everyone to get used to the code and next week we will explain everything that is not understandable in our work, thanks to the tasks what we share among ourselves. If anyone would like to help with the preparation of the list too, or have other questions or suggestions or maybe problems, please let me know and write about it on the channel. we should help each other :) .

If someone has a problem with using Github, I recommend this link -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci3W1T88mzw&index=53&list=PLIX5kQLXWHaHnsgkOWxgo2TTJfeNXVC0e <- the movie lasts only few minutes and makes life easier.

*This is what the final application should look like:*
